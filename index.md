### **Introduction:**

The following derives from an interview of founding KCC members conducted by a student RA in the summer of 2017. Pema Bhutia (founder) and Tsering Uden Bhutia (director) discussed the process the KCC went through regarding their designation of the Khangchendzonga National Park as a mixed UNESCO World Heritage status as both a natural and cultural site.[^first]

This interview highlights a few significant aspects for discussion, namely the significance of the Sikkim landscape, the limitations/constraints placed by UNESCO on what it acknowledges as culture, what this interview constitutes for the KCC, and how the interview itself can be viewed as a source.

### **The Landscape: Culture & UNESCO**

The interview about the conflict between the KCC and UNESCO in securing a mixed cultural/natural heritage status brings up a very important point – aspects of culture and their significance may not always be corporeal or even tangible.[^third] If we ascribe to oral history theory, the fact that is dwelled upon is likely the most significant point in the mind of the individual being interviewed.[^fourth] It can certainly be said that this interview was centred on their response to the fact that UNESCO was requiring physical, tangible evidence of the Khangchendzonga as a site of cultural significance.[^fifth] The problem is, the significance of the landscape of Sikkim and how it pertains to the array of cultures therein is categorically neither. The landscape is complexly interwoven in the reciprocal relationship between the people of Sikkim’s establishment and maintenance of history, identity, mythology, religion/spirituality, ritual, traditional socio-political and socio-economic structure … the list could go on, but essentially the entire structure of their world view and experience of that, in a relationship where they are more than just passive actors in a static environment, but individuals with agency whose worldviews are fluid.[^sixth] This brings us full circle back to the interview. The interviewees speak of how belief should have been enough for UNESCO to designate Khangchendzonga as a culturally significant heritage site.[^seventh] They further suggest that the policies of UNESCO should be reviewed.[^eighth] They should, I would suggest, include oral tradition in their evidence base, because this very interview is a testament to how significant the Khangchendzonga remains to this day, how its conservation is an active goal,[^ninth] how even since the traditional systems of Sikkim have been altered since the processes of globalism and modernization into something which is a resemblance of its past, the significance has not waned, it has simply flexed to meet new circumstances.[^tenth]

### **Towards the Construction of a Contemporary Oral History**  

Additionally, this interview is significant because it documents both the events and the perceptions of this transitory phase Sikkim is currently in. Further, it allows the community to take control of their own history, and to creates a record and a link for future generations.[^Eleventh]

While the interviewer did a fantastic job adhering to the many conventions of a good interview, it has its limitations. The RA was goods not to lead the discussion, and only intervene in natural pauses for the purpose of clarification. He let the interviewees take the lead.[^Twelfth] However, I fear that we lose some of the benefits of an interview in the oral conventions that they provide, because the interviewees had translate their thoughts into English for our convenience.[^Thirteenth] Additionally, it would have been interesting to interview other individuals from Sikkim who were not formally associated with the KCC, simply because perspectives are so highly varied through the area.[^Fourteenth]
